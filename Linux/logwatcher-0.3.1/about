Overview

watcher is a program designed to log systems statistics when certain criteria are met. It looks for certain triggers and when met, it creates logs and emails a report to a specified email address. It does *not* attempt to save the server in any sort of automated fashion. It simply records data for post-mortem analysis. Think of it as a sort of 'black box'.
It was designed as a tool to be used by the Enterprise Team for troubleshooting and analysis.

[edit] Structure

[edit] /etc/watcher

Description
This is where the core of this program lives. The conf files as well as the functions, modules and templates.
Of note:
watcher.conf
The main configuration file for the program.
modules.conf
The module configuration file which enables and disables what is monitored
[edit] /var/log/watcher

Description
The system holds all of it's logs here. It retains logs up to log_retention days (set in watcher.conf). There are various sub-directories which hold logs related to specific services (ie: apache, mysql) as well as a directory named reports which holds the compiled reports that are emailed.

[edit] Installation

Installation is fairly straight forward and commented. Simply follow these steps:
cd /usr/local/src
wget scripts.ent.liquidweb.com/watcher-current.tar.gz
tar -zxvf watcher-current.tar.gz
cd watcher-*
./installer.sh
This will give you the following output:
Installation Done

Details:
  Install Path:              /etc/watcher
  Primary Config:            /etc/watcher/watcher.conf
  Module Config:             /etc/watcher/modules.conf
  Cron Job:                  /etc/cron.d/watcher

Please be sure to adjust:
 * Primary Config to contain Ticket and Account link as well as thresholds required
 * Module Config to reflect what you wish to be monitored and reported

As it notes, configuration is the next step.

[edit] Configuration

Both configuration files are fairly well commented however I will relay the information here as well.
[edit] watcher.conf

Variables:
email : email address reports are sent to
account_link : full url link to billing account (included in email report)
load_thresh : if system load is greater than or equal to this value, a report is generated and emailed
there is a commented out formula that can be used in lieu of a flat value
load_ticket : ticket related to an ongoing load issue (if any) (included in email report)
swap_thresh : if swap free is less than this number, a report is generated and emailed
swap_ticket : ticket related to an ongoing swap issue (if any) (included in email report)
disk_thresh : if disk usage is higher than this percentage on any partition, a report is generated and emailed
log_retention : if logs are older than this value (in days) they will be removed
[edit] modules.conf

Variables:
All variables in this file have a 1/0 (off/on) value
load_monitor : enables monitoring load
swap_monitor : enables monitoring swap
disk_monitor : enables monitoring disk usage
Notes:
load and swap have some other, sub-variables associated with them. These are for more control of what is being reported. For instance, if the server does not have apache running, reporting of apache can be disabled by setting load_monitor_apache=0 (or swap_monitor_apache=0 if you are monitoring swap)

[edit] Disabling

The watcher reporting can be disabled by setting all service_monitor variables to 0. You do not need to disable the individual reporting services mentioned in the note above.

[edit] Uninstalling

Warning: Uninstalling removes all watcher related files including logs

cd /usr/local/src/watcher-*
./uninstaller.sh
