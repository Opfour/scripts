#This script will monitor system processes, and once finds a process using more then allowed cpu resources, it will automatically invoke "cpulimit" to renice the process.

#Requirements:
#bash, cpulimit http://dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/cpulimit/cpulimit-1.1.tar.gz
#(http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?d â€¦ amp;SeB=nd),
#top(procps), grep, cut(coreutils)
#Code:

THRESHOLD=90
LIMIT=60
TIMEOUT=8

# for
# get top process using cpu resource more then THRESHOLD
# xor with WHITE_LIST
#WHITE_LIST="" # not implement
# xor with BLACK_LIST
#BLACK_LIST="" # not suitable if we limit by PID
# cpulimit it & add to BLACKLIST
# sleep TIMEOUT (default = 15)
# loop

#ps. you can put this in /etc/rc.local
#     (remember to add a "&" to put it in to the background, or you will not be able to finish booting)

#ps2. cpulimit is better executed with root permission, or it will make some problems.

#Hope this helps,
