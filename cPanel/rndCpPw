[edit] Example Commands

/scripts/rndCpPw.pl --cpuser all 16
To ranndomize just the lw cPanel account password to a 16 character password:
/scripts/rndCpPw.pl --cpuser lw 16
To randomize all email account passwords to a 16 character password for all cPanel accounts:
/scripts/rndCpPw.pl --mailbox all 16
To randomize just the lw cPanel account email accounts to a 16 character password:
/scripts/rndCpPw.pl --mailbox lw 16
To randomize just user@lw.com password under the lw cPanel account:
/scripts/rndCpPw.pl --mailbox lw 16 user@lw.com
This feature was made so you could randomize all user@domain.com email accounts only for a specific use case. It was wrapped in this bash loop:
for user in `ls -A /var/cpanel/users`; do domain=$(grep "DNS=" /var/cpanel/users/$user |cut -d "=" -f 2) && /scripts/rndCpPw.pl --mailbox $user 16 user@$domain; done
To randomize all FTP account passwords to a 16 character password for all cPanel accounts:
/scripts/rndCpPw.pl --ftp all 16
To randomize just the lw cPanel account FTP accounts to a 16 character password:
/scripts/rndCpPw.pl --ftp lw 16
